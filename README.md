# Traffic-Light-Voice-Assistant
This project provides a voice assistant for traffic light detection in video footage. Utilizing YOLOv8 for object detection and a text-to-speech (TTS) system, the project detects traffic lights, generates corresponding voice instructions based on the light's color, and integrates these voice instructions back into the video.
